    "image": "/ZUSEicon.png",
    "primary": "I am a Data Analyst with a degree in Cognitive Systems from UBC. My journey began in competitive gaming, where I learned that the best strategies are built on data, not guesses. As an Esports Team Lead, I used analytics to optimize win rates, and now I apply that same rigor to building data pipelines and dashboards. I specialize in Python, SQL, and translating complex metrics into actionable insights for communities and stakeholders.",
    "secondary": "Beyond the code, I'm deeply embedded in gaming culture—often analyzing patch notes or optimizing character builds in games like Umamusume. I want to design games."
